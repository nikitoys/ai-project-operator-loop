# AI Development Operating Model

Status: Draft  
Version: v0.1.0

## Purpose

This document describes the layered operating model of the AI Development System.

It shows which parts are already implemented as documentation, which parts are missing, and which parts require further work.

## Status Legend

Partially Implemented documented indirectly or incompletely
Missing               not yet documented as a separate mechanism

# Summary

## Implemented

```text
Interaction Modes
System Structure
Glossary
Role Lifecycle
Document Lifecycle
Process Lifecycle
Task Lifecycle
Lifecycle Governance
Language and Localization
```

## Partially Implemented

```text
Change Lifecycle
Review Lifecycle
Improvement Lifecycle
```

## Missing

```text
Decision Lifecycle
Codex Execution Lifecycle
QA Lifecycle
Knowledge Lifecycle
Experiment Lifecycle
```

## Highest Priority Next Steps

1. Create `codex-lifecycle.md` because Codex is the execution boundary.
2. Improve `change-process.md` or create `change-lifecycle.md` to define verification, rollback and closure.
3. Create `decision-lifecycle.md` to define decision states, ownership and archival rules.
4. Create `qa-lifecycle.md` because QA approval and regression flow need explicit ownership.
5. Create `knowledge-lifecycle.md` to define how lessons become glossary terms, rules or templates.

## Main Principle

```text
Every managed entity in the AI Development System should have:
- owner;
- source document;
- lifecycle states;
- allowed operations;
- approval rules;
- version impact rules;
- changelog or history rule.
```
