## Highest Priority Next Steps

1. Run the first system health check and record findings in the evolution backlog.
2. Synchronize visible system versions and document statuses across primary entrypoints.
3. Add documentation integrity checks for links, placeholders, indexes and status/version fields.
4. Add security, privacy and data-handling policy.
5. Run pilot validation against real repository tasks and record follow-up improvements.

## Main Principle

```text
Every managed entity in the AI Development System should have:
- owner;
- source document;
- lifecycle states;
- allowed operations;
- approval rules;
- version impact rules;
- changelog or history rule.

Every system evolution item should also have:
- roadmap, backlog, health-check, analytical report or Human Owner source;
- explicit allowed files;
- verification mode;
- review requirement;
- Human Owner approval requirement assessment;
- closure outcome.
```
