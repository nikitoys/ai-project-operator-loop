# AI System Evolution Backlog

Status: Draft  
Version: v0.1.0

## Purpose

This backlog tracks actionable improvements for AI_Development_System itself.

It is separate from product backlogs. Product features, bugs and implementation tasks belong in project-level control files. This backlog is only for system governance, documentation, templates, integration, verification and evolution capability.

## EVOL-001 — Add controlled self-evolution module

Status: Done  
Priority: P0  
Source: Human Owner request and analytical report recommendations  
Roadmap item: P0 — Self-Evolution Governance  
Owner: AI System Maintainer  
Type: Governance

Affected documents:

- `ai-system/evolution/README.md`
- `ai-system/evolution/roadmap.md`
- `ai-system/evolution/evolution-loop.md`
- `ai-system/evolution/evolution-policy.md`
- `ai-system/evolution/system-health-check.md`
- `ai-system/evolution/evolution-backlog.md`
- `ai-system/README.md`
- `ai-system/operating-model.md`
- `ai-system/system-changelog.md`

Problem:

The system has many lifecycle documents and an evolution mode, but it does not yet have a dedicated, indexed module that makes roadmap-driven self-evolution explicit and bounded.

Expected outcome:

Add an internal `ai-system/evolution/` module that defines how the system evolves according to its own plan while preserving Human Owner approval.

Acceptance criteria:

- evolution module index exists;
- roadmap exists;
- evolution loop exists;
- evolution policy exists;
- health check exists;
- backlog exists;
- proposal and task templates exist;
- analytical report baseline is referenced;
- AI system README and operating model reference the module;
- changelog records the change.

Conversion path:

System change.

Notes:

This item is the initial bootstrap for future roadmap-driven self-evolution.

## EVOL-002 — Synchronize versions and document statuses

Status: Done  
Priority: P1  
Source: Analytical report finding  
Roadmap item: P1 — Consistency and Documentation Integrity  
Owner: AI System Maintainer  
Type: Documentation

Problem:

Visible system versions and document statuses can drift between entrypoints and changelog.

Expected outcome:

Define one authoritative version source and update primary entrypoints to avoid conflicting version claims.

Acceptance criteria:

- authoritative version source documented;
- root README and `ai-system/README.md` do not conflict with changelog;
- version/status update rules documented;
- changelog records the fix.

Conversion path:

AICP if versioning policy changes; otherwise documentation task.

Notes:

Completed as a bounded documentation/status synchronization task. The authoritative version source is the top entry in `ai-system/system-changelog.md`; README files mirror it. No AICP was required because this clarified version mirroring and did not change lifecycle states, approval gates or versioning authority.

---

## EVOL-003 — Add documentation integrity checks

Status: Done  
Priority: P1  
Source: Analytical report finding  
Roadmap item: P1 — Consistency and Documentation Integrity  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / DevOps AI  
Type: Verification

Problem:

The repository is documentation-first, but does not yet have automated checks for links, indexes, placeholders or status/version fields.

Expected outcome:

Add a minimal validation workflow or script for documentation integrity.

Acceptance criteria:

- markdown links can be checked;
- unresolved placeholders can be detected;
- index completeness has a documented or automated check;
- status/version fields can be validated for required documents.

Conversion path:

System change and automation task.

Notes:

Completed as a bounded verification task. Added a local documentation integrity checker and GitHub workflow for Markdown links, unresolved placeholder markers outside reusable templates, index completeness and visible status/version consistency. EVOL-004 remains the next recommended phase and was not started.

---

## EVOL-004 — Add security, privacy and data-handling policy

Status: Done  
Priority: P1  
Source: Analytical report finding  
Roadmap item: P2 — Security, Privacy and Data Handling  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / Security Reviewer AI  
Type: Security

Problem:

The system assumes external AI tools and Codex-like execution, but explicit secret-handling, privacy, sandbox and sensitive-data rules are not yet centralized.

Expected outcome:

Add security/privacy/data-handling policy documents and link them from review and verification guidance.

Acceptance criteria:

- secret-handling rules exist;
- external LLM data-sharing rules exist;
- sandbox/execution boundaries exist;
- security review can reference the policy;
- project templates can inherit the policy.

Conversion path:

AICP required.

Notes:

Completed with `ai-system/aicp-security-privacy-policy.md`, centralized security and privacy/data-handling policies, review/rules references and project-template inheritance links. EVOL-005 remains the next recommended phase and was not started.

---

## EVOL-005 — Create golden example project

Status: Done  
Priority: P2  
Source: Analytical report finding  
Roadmap item: P3 — Golden Example and Pilot Validation  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / Technical Writer AI  
Type: Pilot Validation

Problem:

Templates exist, but there is no fully filled example showing a working integration.

Expected outcome:

Create one example repository or example directory with filled project control files.

Acceptance criteria:

- example includes root `AGENTS.md` or foldered equivalent;
- `AI_PROJECT` files are filled;
- verification policy is explicit;
- example workflow can be followed by a new user.

Conversion path:

Experiment or system change depending on repository structure.

Notes:

- Added `examples/golden-project/` as a filled Task Tracker foldered reference with a complete control layer and no application code.
- The example focuses on `AI_PROJECT` control files and foldered bootstrap behavior for onboarding.

---

## EVOL-006 — Introduce machine-checkable specification layer

Status: Done  
Priority: P2  
Source: Analytical report finding  
Roadmap item: P4 — Machine-Checkable Specification Layer  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / System Architect AI  
Type: Automation

Problem:

Roles, modes, lifecycle states and verification rules are currently Markdown-first, which creates drift risk.

Expected outcome:

Introduce `spec/` with YAML/JSON definitions for selected stable system entities and define Markdown/spec source-of-truth rules.

Acceptance criteria:

- first spec area selected;
- schema defined;
- validation process documented;
- generated/derived documentation policy defined.

Conversion path:

AICP required.

Notes:

- Added `spec/` as a minimal JSON-based machine-checkable layer for roles, interaction modes, verification modes and common lifecycle states.
- Added a shared minimal JSON Schema and validation guidance in `spec/README.md`.
- Markdown remains the operational source of truth; EVOL-006 does not regenerate Markdown, add CI schema lint, delete existing docs or start bootstrap/release/research work.

---

## EVOL-007 — Add minimal foldered bootstrap/update tooling MVP

Status: Done  
Priority: P2  
Source: Human Owner request after EVOL-006  
Roadmap item: P5 — Bootstrap and Update Tooling  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / DevOps Engineer AI / Technical Writer AI  
Type: Automation

Problem:

Foldered integration is documented and templated, but there is no minimal local helper for dry-run bootstrap/update planning, placeholder detection or `AI_DEV_SYSTEM_VERSION.md` tracking.

Expected outcome:

Add a small script-level MVP that can inspect or prepare foldered control-layer setup without creating a large CLI, package or release automation system.

Acceptance criteria:

- dry-run is the default mode;
- explicit apply mode exists for bounded file creation/update;
- unresolved placeholders are reported;
- `AI_PROJECT/AI_DEV_SYSTEM_VERSION.md` can be created or refreshed;
- docs explain that application code is not modified;
- changelog records the change.

Conversion path:

System change and automation task.

Notes:

- Added `scripts/foldered-control-mvp.py` with `bootstrap` and `update` commands, dry-run by default and explicit `--apply` for writes.
- The MVP creates missing foldered control files from templates during bootstrap and refreshes `AI_PROJECT/AI_DEV_SYSTEM_VERSION.md` during update.
- Large CLI/package/release automation, upstream clone/subtree management and product-code changes remain out of scope.

## EVOL-008 — Record SOP and Multi-Agent Implementation Plan

Status: Done  
Priority: P1  
Source: Human Owner request  
Roadmap item: P6 — SOP and Optional Multi-Agent Execution Layer  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / Technical Writer AI  
Type: Documentation

Problem:

The Human Owner wants AI_Development_System to evolve toward SOP-guided planning and optional multi-agent execution, but the direction must be recorded without implementing runtime behavior or replacing the safe one-task loop.

Expected outcome:

Create a master implementation plan and decompose the initiative into future bounded evolution tasks.

Acceptance criteria:

- implementation plan document exists;
- sequential execution remains the default;
- parallel execution is opt-in and Human Owner-approved;
- planning, specs, tooling, templates, pilot and runtime decision phases are separated;
- future backlog items are added;
- changelog records the change.

Conversion path:

System documentation task.

Notes:

Recorded in `ai-system/evolution/sop-multi-agent-implementation-plan.md`. No runtime, scripts, specs, templates or execution behavior changes were implemented.

---

## EVOL-009 — Add SOP Model document

Status: Done  
Priority: P1  
Source: `sop-multi-agent-implementation-plan.md`  
Roadmap item: P6 — SOP and Optional Multi-Agent Execution Layer  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / Technical Writer AI  
Type: Governance

Problem:

The system does not yet define what a SOP is, how SOPs are selected or how SOPs relate to existing workflow and task lifecycle.

Expected outcome:

Add `ai-system/sop-model.md`.

Acceptance criteria:

- SOP definition exists;
- SOP selection process is documented;
- relationship to existing workflow, task lifecycle and prompt lifecycle is clear;
- sequential execution remains default.

Conversion path:

System change or documentation task depending on behavior impact.

Notes:

Completed with `ai-system/sop-model.md`. The SOP Model defines managed SOPs, required fields, relationships to workflow, roles, task lifecycle, prompt lifecycle, Codex lifecycle, review and QA, and three initial SOPs: `SOP-FEATURE-001`, `SOP-BUGFIX-001` and `SOP-SYSTEM-001`.

Sequential execution remains the default. SOPs do not authorize automatic execution, automatic acceptance, Agent Work Package generation or parallel execution. EVOL-010 remains the next bounded phase and was not started.

---

## EVOL-010 — Add Agent Work Package standard

Status: Done  
Priority: P1  
Source: `sop-multi-agent-implementation-plan.md`  
Roadmap item: P6 — SOP and Optional Multi-Agent Execution Layer  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / Technical Writer AI  
Type: Governance

Problem:

Agent work must be explicit, bounded and reviewable before any multi-agent planning can be safe.

Expected outcome:

Add `ai-system/agent-work-package.md`.

Acceptance criteria:

- required work package fields are defined;
- dependencies, `allowed_files`, `locked_files`, verification mode and acceptance criteria are mandatory;
- result format is defined;
- Human Owner approval remains required before execution.

Conversion path:

System change.

Notes:

Completed with `ai-system/agent-work-package.md`. The standard defines managed Agent Work Packages, required fields, lifecycle/status values, ownership, relationship to SOPs, tasks, prompts, Codex execution, review and QA, and examples for backend, frontend, QA/review and documentation work.

Agent Work Packages do not imply parallel execution and do not authorize automatic execution or automatic acceptance. EVOL-011 remains the next bounded phase and was not started.

---

## EVOL-011 — Add Multi-Agent Planning workflow

Status: Done  
Priority: P1  
Source: `sop-multi-agent-implementation-plan.md`  
Roadmap item: P6 — SOP and Optional Multi-Agent Execution Layer  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / Project Manager AI / Technical Writer AI  
Type: Lifecycle

Problem:

The system needs a planning-only workflow for decomposing owner intent into Agent Work Packages without executing them.

Expected outcome:

Add `ai-system/multi-agent-planning.md`.

Acceptance criteria:

- planning workflow is documented;
- decomposition stops before execution;
- Human Owner approval gate is explicit;
- output can feed existing Codex prompt packages.

Conversion path:

System change.

Notes:

Completed with `ai-system/multi-agent-planning.md`. The workflow defines managed multi-agent plans, planning inputs and outputs, status values, decomposition rules, dependency identification, file-scope and locked-file planning, Human Owner approval points and the path from plan to one next bounded executable work item.

Candidate parallel groups are informational planning output only. Multi-Agent Planning does not authorize execution, parallel execution, automatic execution or automatic acceptance. EVOL-012 remains the next bounded phase and was not started.

---

## EVOL-012 — Add Parallel Execution Policy

Status: Done  
Priority: P1  
Source: `sop-multi-agent-implementation-plan.md`  
Roadmap item: P6 — SOP and Optional Multi-Agent Execution Layer  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / Code Reviewer AI / QA Engineer AI  
Type: Governance

Problem:

Parallel execution can create conflicts unless allowed, denied and approval-required cases are explicit.

Expected outcome:

Add `ai-system/parallel-execution-policy.md`.

Acceptance criteria:

- allowed parallel execution conditions are documented;
- forbidden cases are documented;
- file-lock and dependency conflict rules exist;
- Human Owner approval is required for every parallel group.

Conversion path:

System change.

Notes:

Completed with `ai-system/parallel-execution-policy.md`. The policy defines managed parallel execution groups, default sequential execution, explicit Human Owner approval, eligibility and rejection criteria, dependency checks, `allowed_files` and `locked_files` conflict rules, file-lock ownership, approval gates, mandatory integration review, QA relationship, rollback/rework expectations, result intake expectations and security/privacy boundaries.

Parallel execution does not authorize automatic execution, automatic merge or automatic acceptance. EVOL-013 remains the next bounded phase and was not started.

---

## EVOL-013 — Add Agent Result Intake and Integration Review

Status: Proposed  
Priority: P1  
Source: `sop-multi-agent-implementation-plan.md`  
Roadmap item: P6 — SOP and Optional Multi-Agent Execution Layer  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / Code Reviewer AI / QA Engineer AI / Technical Writer AI  
Type: Review

Problem:

The system needs a controlled process for receiving agent outputs, integrating them and deciding whether they pass review and QA.

Expected outcome:

Add `ai-system/agent-result-intake.md` and `ai-system/integration-review.md`.

Acceptance criteria:

- result intake process is documented;
- integration review process is documented;
- review, QA, rework and rejection paths are explicit;
- automatic acceptance is forbidden.

Conversion path:

System change.

---

## EVOL-014 — Add machine-checkable SOP and Agent Work Package specs

Status: Proposed  
Priority: P2  
Source: `sop-multi-agent-implementation-plan.md`  
Roadmap item: P6 — SOP and Optional Multi-Agent Execution Layer  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / System Architect AI  
Type: Automation

Problem:

SOPs, Agent Work Packages, result objects and parallel policy need machine-checkable representations after the Markdown source documents exist.

Expected outcome:

Add `spec/sops.json`, `spec/agent-work-package.schema.json`, `spec/agent-result.schema.json` and `spec/parallel-policy.json`.

Acceptance criteria:

- specs map to approved Markdown source documents;
- schema validation guidance is updated;
- no Markdown generation is introduced unless separately approved.

Conversion path:

System change.

---

## EVOL-015 — Add AI_PROJECT agent planning templates

Status: Proposed  
Priority: P2  
Source: `sop-multi-agent-implementation-plan.md`  
Roadmap item: P6 — SOP and Optional Multi-Agent Execution Layer  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / Technical Writer AI  
Type: Template

Problem:

Concrete projects need local files for agent planning, locks, results and metrics only after the system standards exist.

Expected outcome:

Add templates for `AI_PROJECT/AGENT_PLAN.md`, `AI_PROJECT/AGENT_TASKS.md`, `AI_PROJECT/AGENT_LOCKS.md`, `AI_PROJECT/AGENT_RESULTS.md` and `AI_PROJECT/AGENT_METRICS.md`.

Acceptance criteria:

- templates inherit approved SOP and Agent Work Package rules;
- templates preserve one-task default behavior;
- templates do not enable automatic execution.

Conversion path:

System change and template task.

---

Status: Proposed  
Priority: P2  
Source: `sop-multi-agent-implementation-plan.md`  
Roadmap item: P6 — SOP and Optional Multi-Agent Execution Layer  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / DevOps Engineer AI  
Type: Automation

Problem:

Agent planning should be validated before runtime execution is considered.

Expected outcome:

Add `scripts/agent-plan-mvp.py` as a dry-run planner and validator.

Acceptance criteria:

- dry-run is default;
- agent plans can be validated;
- file-lock conflicts can be detected;
- safe parallel groups can be listed;
- bounded prompts can be generated for review;
- Codex is not executed automatically.

Conversion path:

Automation task.

---

## EVOL-017 — Extend golden project with multi-agent example

Source: `sop-multi-agent-implementation-plan.md`  
Roadmap item: P6 — SOP and Optional Multi-Agent Execution Layer  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / Technical Writer AI  
Type: Pilot Validation

Problem:

The golden project should demonstrate SOP/multi-agent planning only after documents, templates and planner rules exist.

Expected outcome:

Extend `examples/golden-project/` with a non-runtime multi-agent planning example.

Acceptance criteria:

- example includes agent plan files;
- example demonstrates dependency and file-lock reasoning;
- example does not run agents automatically;
- example preserves Human Owner approval.

Conversion path:

Example and pilot-preparation task.

---

## EVOL-018 — Run pilot validation and record findings

Status: Proposed  
Priority: P2  
Source: `sop-multi-agent-implementation-plan.md`  
Roadmap item: P6 — SOP and Optional Multi-Agent Execution Layer  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / QA Engineer AI / Technical Writer AI

Problem:

Runtime decisions should be based on evidence from controlled pilots, not assumptions.

Expected outcome:

Run pilot validation and record findings before deciding whether runtime integration is justified.

Acceptance criteria:

- pilot scope is approved;
- findings are recorded;
- repeated issues are converted into backlog items or policy updates;
- runtime decision remains deferred.

Conversion path:

Pilot validation task.

---

## EVOL-019 — Decide whether runtime integration is justified

Status: Proposed  
Priority: P3  
Source: `sop-multi-agent-implementation-plan.md`  
Roadmap item: P6 — SOP and Optional Multi-Agent Execution Layer  
Owner: Human Owner / AI System Maintainer

Problem:

The system should not become a runtime unless pilot evidence shows the governance-first workflow benefits from it.

Expected outcome:

Decide whether to reject, defer, experiment with or approve runtime integration.

Acceptance criteria:

- pilot evidence is reviewed;
- risks and benefits are documented;
- Human Owner decision is recorded;
- any runtime work requires a new bounded backlog item and approval.

Conversion path:

Decision or experiment proposal.
