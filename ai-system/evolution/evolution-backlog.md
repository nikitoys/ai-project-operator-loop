# AI System Evolution Backlog

Status: Draft  
Version: v0.1.0

## Purpose

This backlog tracks actionable improvements for AI_Development_System itself.

It is separate from product backlogs. Product features, bugs and implementation tasks belong in project-level control files. This backlog is only for system governance, documentation, templates, integration, verification and evolution capability.

## EVOL-001 — Add controlled self-evolution module

Status: Done  
Priority: P0  
Source: Human Owner request and analytical report recommendations  
Roadmap item: P0 — Self-Evolution Governance  
Owner: AI System Maintainer  
Type: Governance

Affected documents:

- `ai-system/evolution/README.md`
- `ai-system/evolution/roadmap.md`
- `ai-system/evolution/evolution-loop.md`
- `ai-system/evolution/evolution-policy.md`
- `ai-system/evolution/system-health-check.md`
- `ai-system/evolution/evolution-backlog.md`
- `ai-system/README.md`
- `ai-system/operating-model.md`
- `ai-system/system-changelog.md`

Problem:

The system has many lifecycle documents and an evolution mode, but it does not yet have a dedicated, indexed module that makes roadmap-driven self-evolution explicit and bounded.

Expected outcome:

Add an internal `ai-system/evolution/` module that defines how the system evolves according to its own plan while preserving Human Owner approval.

Acceptance criteria:

- evolution module index exists;
- roadmap exists;
- evolution loop exists;
- evolution policy exists;
- health check exists;
- backlog exists;
- proposal and task templates exist;
- analytical report baseline is referenced;
- AI system README and operating model reference the module;
- changelog records the change.

Conversion path:

System change.

Notes:

This item is the initial bootstrap for future roadmap-driven self-evolution.

## EVOL-002 — Synchronize versions and document statuses

Status: Done  
Priority: P1  
Source: Analytical report finding  
Roadmap item: P1 — Consistency and Documentation Integrity  
Owner: AI System Maintainer  
Type: Documentation

Problem:

Visible system versions and document statuses can drift between entrypoints and changelog.

Expected outcome:

Define one authoritative version source and update primary entrypoints to avoid conflicting version claims.

Acceptance criteria:

- authoritative version source documented;
- root README and `ai-system/README.md` do not conflict with changelog;
- version/status update rules documented;
- changelog records the fix.

Conversion path:

AICP if versioning policy changes; otherwise documentation task.

Notes:

Completed as a bounded documentation/status synchronization task. The authoritative version source is the top entry in `ai-system/system-changelog.md`; README files mirror it. No AICP was required because this clarified version mirroring and did not change lifecycle states, approval gates or versioning authority.

## EVOL-003 — Add documentation integrity checks

Status: Done  
Priority: P1  
Source: Analytical report finding  
Roadmap item: P1 — Consistency and Documentation Integrity  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / DevOps AI  
Type: Verification

Problem:

The repository is documentation-first, but does not yet have automated checks for links, indexes, placeholders or status/version fields.

Expected outcome:

Add a minimal validation workflow or script for documentation integrity.

Acceptance criteria:

- markdown links can be checked;
- unresolved placeholders can be detected;
- index completeness has a documented or automated check;
- status/version fields can be validated for required documents.

Conversion path:

System change and automation task.

Notes:

Completed as a bounded verification task. Added a local documentation integrity checker and GitHub workflow for Markdown links, unresolved placeholder markers outside reusable templates, index completeness and visible status/version consistency. EVOL-004 remains the next recommended phase and was not started.

## EVOL-004 — Add security, privacy and data-handling policy

Status: Done  
Priority: P1  
Source: Analytical report finding  
Roadmap item: P2 — Security, Privacy and Data Handling  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / Security Reviewer AI  
Type: Security

Problem:

The system assumes external AI tools and Codex-like execution, but explicit secret-handling, privacy, sandbox and sensitive-data rules are not yet centralized.

Expected outcome:

Add security/privacy/data-handling policy documents and link them from review and verification guidance.

Acceptance criteria:

- secret-handling rules exist;
- external LLM data-sharing rules exist;
- sandbox/execution boundaries exist;
- security review can reference the policy;
- project templates can inherit the policy.

Conversion path:

AICP required.

Notes:

Completed with `ai-system/aicp-security-privacy-policy.md`, centralized security and privacy/data-handling policies, review/rules references and project-template inheritance links. EVOL-005 remains the next recommended phase and was not started.

## EVOL-005 — Create golden example project

Status: Done  
Priority: P2  
Source: Analytical report finding  
Roadmap item: P3 — Golden Example and Pilot Validation  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / Technical Writer AI  
Type: Pilot Validation

Problem:

Templates exist, but there is no fully filled example showing a working integration.

Expected outcome:

Create one example repository or example directory with filled project control files.

Acceptance criteria:

- example includes root `AGENTS.md` or foldered equivalent;
- `AI_PROJECT` files are filled;
- verification policy is explicit;
- example workflow can be followed by a new user.

Conversion path:

Experiment or system change depending on repository structure.

Notes:

- Added `examples/golden-project/` as a filled Task Tracker foldered reference with a complete control layer and no application code.
- The example focuses on `AI_PROJECT` control files and foldered bootstrap behavior for onboarding.

## EVOL-006 — Introduce machine-checkable specification layer

Status: Done  
Priority: P2  
Source: Analytical report finding  
Roadmap item: P4 — Machine-Checkable Specification Layer  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / System Architect AI  
Type: Automation

Problem:

Roles, modes, lifecycle states and verification rules are currently Markdown-first, which creates drift risk.

Expected outcome:

Introduce `spec/` with YAML/JSON definitions for selected stable system entities and define Markdown/spec source-of-truth rules.

Acceptance criteria:

- first spec area selected;
- schema defined;
- validation process documented;
- generated/derived documentation policy defined.

Conversion path:

AICP required.

Notes:

- Added `spec/` as a minimal JSON-based machine-checkable layer for roles, interaction modes, verification modes and common lifecycle states.
- Added a shared minimal JSON Schema and validation guidance in `spec/README.md`.
- Markdown remains the operational source of truth; EVOL-006 does not regenerate Markdown, add CI schema lint, delete existing docs or start bootstrap/release/research work.

## EVOL-007 — Add minimal foldered bootstrap/update tooling MVP

Status: Done  
Priority: P2  
Source: Human Owner request after EVOL-006  
Roadmap item: P5 — Bootstrap and Update Tooling  
Owner: AI System Maintainer / DevOps Engineer AI / Technical Writer AI  
Type: Automation

Problem:

Foldered integration is documented and templated, but there is no minimal local helper for dry-run bootstrap/update planning, placeholder detection or `AI_DEV_SYSTEM_VERSION.md` tracking.

Expected outcome:

Add a small script-level MVP that can inspect or prepare foldered control-layer setup without creating a large CLI, package or release automation system.

Acceptance criteria:

- dry-run is the default mode;
- explicit apply mode exists for bounded file creation/update;
- unresolved placeholders are reported;
- `AI_PROJECT/AI_DEV_SYSTEM_VERSION.md` can be created or refreshed;
- docs explain that application code is not modified;
- changelog records the change.

Conversion path:

System change and automation task.

Notes:

- Added `scripts/foldered-control-mvp.py` with `bootstrap` and `update` commands, dry-run by default and explicit `--apply` for writes.
- The MVP creates missing foldered control files from templates during bootstrap and refreshes `AI_PROJECT/AI_DEV_SYSTEM_VERSION.md` during update.
- Large CLI/package/release automation, upstream clone/subtree management and product-code changes remain out of scope.
