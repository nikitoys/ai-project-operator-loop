# AI Development System

Status: Draft  
Version: v0.1.0

## Purpose

`/ai-system` describes how this repository is developed through an AI-assisted development process.

This folder does not describe the product itself. It describes the development mechanism: roles, rules, workflow, human interaction, task format, review process and controlled evolution of the system.

## Core Principle

Documentation is the source of truth.

AI roles do not work from inspiration. They work from approved documents, explicit tasks and defined acceptance criteria.

## System Layers

```text
AI Development System
├── Human Owner
├── ChatGPT Orchestrator
├── Codex Executor
├── AI Roles
├── Documentation
├── Workflow
├── Rules
├── Review Process
├── Evolution Process
└── System Evolution Module
```

## Repository Model

  /backend     # backend implementation
  /frontend    # frontend implementation
  /infra       # deployment and infrastructure

## Evolution Module

The `evolution/` directory defines roadmap-driven self-evolution of AI_Development_System.

- `evolution/README.md` — index and operating principle for the system evolution module.
- `evolution/roadmap.md` — strategic and tactical roadmap for AI_Development_System.
- `evolution/evolution-loop.md` — observe → diagnose → propose → plan → execute → verify → review → approve → release → learn loop.
- `evolution/evolution-policy.md` — permissions, boundaries and anti-runaway rules for self-evolution.
- `evolution/system-health-check.md` — repeatable system health-check checklist.
- `evolution/evolution-backlog.md` — managed backlog of system evolution items.
- `evolution/analysis-report-baseline.md` — baseline findings from the analytical repository report.
- `evolution/templates/system-change-proposal.md` — AI System Change Proposal template.
- `evolution/templates/evolution-task.md` — bounded system evolution task template.

## Templates

- `templates/foldered/` — recommended templates for `AGENTS.md`, `AI_Development_System/` and `AI_PROJECT/` integration.
- `templates/project/` — root-mode templates for simple or legacy projects.

## Operating Model

```text
Human Owner sets direction
ChatGPT Orchestrator prepares documents, prompts and reviews
Codex Executor changes repository files
Documentation records decisions
AI Development System controls the process
System Evolution Module controls roadmap-driven self-improvement
```

## Minimal Rule

No implementation task should start without:

- a task from the backlog;
- required source documents;
- clear scope and out of scope;
- acceptance criteria;
- expected output;
- review step.

No system evolution task should start without:

- a roadmap item, backlog item, health-check finding, analytical report finding or Human Owner request;
- explicit allowed files;
- verification mode;
- review requirements;
- Human Owner approval requirement assessment;
- changelog impact assessment.
