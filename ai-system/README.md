# AI Development System

Status: Draft  
Version: v0.21.0

## Purpose

`/ai-system` describes how this repository is developed through an AI-assisted development process.

This folder does not describe the product itself. It describes the development mechanism: roles, rules, workflow, human interaction, task format, review process and controlled evolution of the system.

## Core Principle

Documentation is the source of truth.

AI roles do not work from inspiration. They work from approved documents, explicit tasks and defined acceptance criteria.

## Version Source

The current AI_Development_System version is the top version entry in `system-changelog.md`.

Primary README files mirror that changelog version and must be updated whenever the top changelog version changes.

## Documentation Integrity Checks

Run the repository documentation integrity checks with:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-docs-integrity.py
```

The check covers internal Markdown links, unresolved placeholders outside reusable templates, index completeness for system documents and visible status/version consistency.

## Foldered Bootstrap/Update Helper

Run minimal dry-run planning for Foldered Control Mode with:

```bash
python3 scripts/foldered-control-mvp.py bootstrap --project-root /path/to/project
python3 scripts/foldered-control-mvp.py update --project-root /path/to/project
```

The helper reports planned control-layer changes, unresolved placeholders and `AI_PROJECT/AI_DEV_SYSTEM_VERSION.md` tracking. Writes require explicit `--apply`.

## Machine-Checkable Specs

Minimal machine-checkable specs are stored in `../spec/`.

Current spec files:

- `../spec/roles.json` — AI role registry snapshot.
- `../spec/interaction-modes.json` — explicit interaction modes and markers.
- `../spec/verification-modes.json` — supported verification modes and execution boundaries.
- `../spec/lifecycle-states.json` — common managed lifecycle states.
- `../spec/schemas/system-spec.schema.json` — shared minimal schema for spec files.

Markdown remains the operational source of truth. Specs are derived inventory and contract files unless a later approved evolution task changes the source-of-truth relationship.

## Security and Privacy Baseline

AI-assisted work must follow:

- `security-policy.md` for secrets, sandbox boundaries, sensitive code and security review;
- `privacy-data-handling-policy.md` for private data, external LLM sharing and data minimization.

Codex Executor changes repository files
Documentation records decisions
AI Development System controls the process
System Evolution Module controls roadmap-driven self-improvement
```

## Minimal Rule

No implementation task should start without:

- a task from the backlog;
- required source documents;
- clear scope and out of scope;
- acceptance criteria;
- expected output;
- review step.

No system evolution task should start without:

- a roadmap item, backlog item, health-check finding, analytical report finding or Human Owner request;
- owner plan intake and mapping when the source is a broad Human Owner evolution plan;
- explicit allowed files;
- verification mode;
- review requirements;
- Human Owner approval requirement assessment;
- changelog impact assessment.
