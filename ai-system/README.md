# AI Development System

Status: Draft  
Version: v0.46.0

## Purpose

`/ai-system` describes how this repository is developed through an AI-assisted development process.

This folder does not describe the product itself. It describes the development mechanism: roles, rules, workflow, human interaction, task format, review process and controlled evolution of the system.

## Core Principle

Documentation is the source of truth.

AI roles do not work from inspiration. They work from approved documents, explicit tasks and defined acceptance criteria.

## Version Source

The current AI_Development_System version is the top version entry in `system-changelog.md`.

Primary README files mirror that changelog version and must be updated whenever the top changelog version changes.

## Documentation Integrity Checks

Run the repository documentation integrity checks with:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-docs-integrity.py
```

The check covers internal Markdown links, unresolved placeholders outside reusable templates, index completeness for system documents and visible status/version consistency.

Run the full read-only system validation with:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate-system.py
```

The full validation entrypoint compiles planning scripts, checks documentation integrity, parses JSON specs, validates required agent planning templates, runs dependency-aware planning fixtures and validates the golden project dry-run plan.

Run lightweight verification check selection with:

```bash
python3 scripts/verification/run_checks.py --mode FAST --budget-sec 120 --dry-run
python3 scripts/verification/run_checks.py --mode STANDARD --budget-sec 300 --dry-run
```

The lightweight runner records executed and skipped checks as local JSONL history. It does not treat unimplemented check commands as passed.

## Foldered Bootstrap/Update Helper

Run minimal dry-run planning for Foldered Control Mode with:

```bash
python3 scripts/foldered-control-mvp.py bootstrap --project-root /path/to/project
python3 scripts/foldered-control-mvp.py update --project-root /path/to/project
```

The helper reports planned control-layer changes, unresolved placeholders and `AI_PROJECT/AI_DEV_SYSTEM_VERSION.md` tracking. Writes require explicit `--apply`.

Foldered projects include `AI_PROJECT/PROJECT_OPERATION_PROFILE.md` as a Human Owner-editable surface profile for language, answer style, verification defaults, permissions, layout and review expectations.

Run dry-run agent planning checks with:

```bash
python3 scripts/agent-plan-mvp.py validate --project-root /path/to/project
python3 scripts/agent-plan-mvp.py check-locks --project-root /path/to/project
python3 scripts/agent-plan-mvp.py list-parallel-groups --project-root /path/to/project
python3 scripts/agent-plan-mvp.py generate-prompts --project-root /path/to/project
```

The helper only reads `AI_PROJECT/AGENT_*` files and prints reports or prompt drafts. It does not execute Codex, create branches, merge changes, accept results or modify application code.

## Machine-Checkable Specs

Minimal machine-checkable specs are stored in `../spec/`.

Current spec files:

- `../spec/roles.json` — AI role registry snapshot.
- `../spec/interaction-modes.json` — explicit interaction modes and markers.
- `../spec/verification-modes.json` — supported verification modes and execution boundaries.
- `../spec/lifecycle-states.json` — common managed lifecycle states.
- `../spec/sops.json` — SOP inventory for initial SOP Model entries.
- `../spec/agent-work-package.schema.json` — JSON Schema contract for Agent Work Packages.
- `../spec/agent-result.schema.json` — JSON Schema contract for Agent Results.
- `../spec/role-agent-assignment.schema.json` — JSON Schema contract for manual L3 Role-to-Agent Assignments.
- `../spec/parallel-policy.json` — policy inventory for core parallel execution constraints.
- `../spec/schemas/system-spec.schema.json` — shared minimal schema for spec files.

Markdown remains the operational source of truth. Specs are derived inventory and contract files unless a later approved evolution task changes the source-of-truth relationship. Specs do not authorize runtime behavior, automatic execution, automatic merge or automatic acceptance.

## Verification Check Registry

`spec/verification-checks.json` under this `/ai-system` folder defines machine-readable check metadata for the lightweight verification runner.

It records check IDs, value classes, speed classes, expected durations, timeouts, default modes, tags and command availability. Markdown policy remains the source of truth.

## SOP Model

`sop-model.md` defines managed SOPs as governance-first planning procedures for repeated classes of work.

Sequential execution remains the default. SOPs do not authorize automatic execution, automatic acceptance or parallel execution.

## Agent Work Package Standard

`agent-work-package.md` defines bounded Agent Work Packages for future SOP-guided planning.

Agent Work Packages do not imply parallel execution and do not authorize automatic execution or automatic acceptance.

## Multi-Agent Planning

`multi-agent-planning.md` defines planning-only decomposition into Agent Work Packages.

Candidate parallel groups are informational only until a future Parallel Execution Policy exists and Human Owner approves them.

## Parallel Execution Policy

`parallel-execution-policy.md` defines when parallel execution is allowed, rejected and approved.

Sequential execution remains the default. Parallel execution is opt-in, Human Owner-approved and requires dependency, file-lock, integration review and QA gates.

## Agent Result Intake and Integration Review

`agent-result-intake.md` defines how individual Agent Work Package results are received and checked before review, QA or integration review.

`integration-review.md` defines how combined agent result sets are checked before QA handoff and Human Owner acceptance.

Intake and integration review do not authorize automatic execution, automatic merge or automatic acceptance.

Agent Result Intake defines the hardened Agent Result schema for manual orchestration, including structured changed files, claims, verification, risks, blockers, followups, scope compliance, safety boundary compliance and review requirements.

## Runtime Maturity Levels

`runtime-maturity-levels.md` defines runtime maturity levels from `L0 — Documentation only` through `L6 — Autonomous runtime`.

The current level is `L3 — Manual multi-agent orchestration`. Runtime execution remains `DEFERRED`; `L4+` is future/not approved.

## Manual Multi-Agent Orchestration

`manual-orchestration.md` defines the L3 manual orchestration workflow.

Manual orchestration coordinates Agent Work Packages, result intake and integration review by hand. It does not authorize automatic Codex execution, automatic multi-agent execution, branch/worktree automation, merge automation, automatic acceptance or automatic QA/review closure.

`role-agent-assignment.md` defines manual Role-to-Agent Assignments for L3. Assignments map ready Agent Work Packages to logical agents or external sessions and do not authorize automatic dispatch or runtime execution.

`l3-role-assigned-parallel-runbook.md` provides the practical Human Owner / ChatGPT Orchestrator procedure for manual role-assigned parallel orchestration.

## AI_PROJECT Agent Planning Templates

Foldered project templates include `PROJECT_OPERATION_PROFILE.md`, `AGENT_PLAN.md`, `AGENT_TASKS.md`, `AGENT_ASSIGNMENTS.md`, `AGENT_LOCKS.md`, `AGENT_RESULTS.md` and `AGENT_METRICS.md`.

These files are planning and review records only. They preserve sequential execution as the default and do not authorize execution, parallel execution, automatic merge or automatic acceptance.

The golden project includes a filled multi-agent planning example under `../examples/golden-project/AI_PROJECT/AGENT_*`.

The SOP / optional multi-agent pilot validation record is stored in `evolution/sop-multi-agent-pilot-validation.md`.

## Security and Privacy Baseline

AI-assisted work must follow:

- `security-policy.md` for secrets, sandbox boundaries, sensitive code and security review;
- `privacy-data-handling-policy.md` for private data, external LLM sharing and data minimization.

## Verification Cost and Runtime Tracking

`verification-cost-model.md` defines speed classes, value classes, check results, blocking/advisory impact and budget-based check selection.

`test-runtime-tracking.md` defines JSONL runtime history fields, local-only history boundaries and runtime degradation warnings.

Slow, full, release, browser, visual and golden-scenario checks remain opt-in unless the selected verification mode explicitly allows them.

```

## Minimal Rule

No implementation task should start without:

- a task from the backlog;
- required source documents;
- clear scope and out of scope;
- acceptance criteria;
- expected output;
- review step.

No system evolution task should start without:

- a roadmap item, backlog item, health-check finding, analytical report finding or Human Owner request;
- owner plan intake and mapping when the source is a broad Human Owner evolution plan;
- explicit allowed files;
- verification mode;
- review requirements;
- Human Owner approval requirement assessment;
- changelog impact assessment.
